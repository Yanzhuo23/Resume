## Research Experience

### Digital Medical Booking System and Potential Inequality of Healthcare Service  
*Dec 2024 – May 2025*  
- **Objective:** This study aims to investigate the relationships between users’ experiences with Online MedicalAppointment Booking Systems—including perceived ease of use, satisfaction, appointment delays, and bookingsuccess rates—and their disease-related conditions and sociodemographic characteristics.
- **Methods:** A cross-sectional survey was conducted via random sampling among individuals aged 40 and above in Hebei, Jiangsu, and Sichuan Provinces, all of whom had prior experience with Online Medical Appointment Booking Systems.
- **Results:** Participants who were older, lived in rural areas, had lower income or education levels, or reported poorer health were more likely to experience difficulties using the online booking system. These difficulties were often linked to appointment delays and lower booking success rates. Among participants with chronic conditions, such as hypertension or digestive diseases, those who faced delays also reported more severe symptoms and more urgent care needs. Dissatisfaction with the system was commonly observed among individuals with greater disease burdens.
- **Conclusions:** These findings provide evidence of the ’inverse care law’ in digital healthcare, highlighting persistent disparities in users’ experiences with online appointment systems, where those with greatest medical needs (older adults, rural residents, individuals with lower education or more severe health conditions) face the most significant barriers. As digital healthcare tools become more widespread, ensuring system usability and accessibility for vulnerable groups will be essential for promoting equitable and effective healthcare delivery

### The Association Between Shift Work, Sleep Quality, and Health Related Quality of Life Among Workers in the Logistics Industry
*Dec 2023 – Aug 2024*  
- **Objective:** This study aimed to investigate the association between night-shift work and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among logistics workers in China, with a particular focus on the mediating role of sleep characteristics.
- **Methods:** The survey collected data on shift work, sleep characteristics (measured by the Insomnia Severity Index), HRQoL (assessed by the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey, including physical and mental
components), sociodemographic factors, and job categories. Linear regression analysis was used to explore the association between night-shift work and HRQoL, while structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to assess the mediating role of sleep quality.
- **Results:** Out of 484 respondents, 72.7 per cent were night-shift workers, who were more likely to be male, smokers, alcohol users, less educated, and engaged in longer working hours within transportation and distribution jobs. The study found a significant decline in general health among night-shift workers compared to day workers. A negative association was identified between the frequency of night shifts and physical health, with those working more than 12 night shifts per month reporting worse health outcomes. Sleep quality was found to significantly mediate the relationship between night-shift work and HRQoL.
- **Conclusions:** The study highlights the detrimental impact of frequent night-shift work on the health-related quality of life of logistics workers and emphasises the crucial mediating role of sleep quality. These findings suggest that improving sleep quality should be a priority to promote the health and well-being of logistics workers.

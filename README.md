## Research Experience

### Epidemiological Analysis of Digital Medical Consultation Booking System and Potential Inequality of Healthcare Service  
*2024 – Present*  
- **Research Content:**
  - Background: This study investigates the impact of an increasing elderly population and extended life expectancy on health service demands, focusing on how the proliferation of e-health services alters elderly people’s access to medical services.
  - Objective: To evaluate health service utilization patterns through Online Registration (OR) and analyze how age and educational levels influence the acceptance and satisfaction with online health services.
  - Methods: Utilizing a cross-sectional study design, a systematic sampling of individuals aged 40 and above from Hebei, Sichuan, and Jiangsu provinces was conducted. The EQ-5D health-related quality of life scale was applied to assess participants’ health status; satisfaction and the urgency of diseases were evaluated using the Likert Scale and the electronic Visual Analogue Scale (eVAS).
  - Statistical Analysis: The data will be subjected to descriptive statistical analysis and multivariate regression analysis to identify key factors influencing the use of the online registration system and discern differences among groups.
  - Expected Outcomes: The results are anticipated to provide an empirical basis for optimizing e-health services for the elderly and support the formulation of public health policies, particularly in enhancing the accessibility and equity of health services.
